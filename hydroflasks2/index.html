          <h1>HYDRO FLASKS</h1>
      </div>

          <ol>
              <p> Hydro Flasks, among other steel re-usable water bottles, are a great way to stay hydrated throughout the say while at the same time protecting the environment from the plastic of traditional water bottles. However, there are a few additional ways you can make your Hydroflask experience even better:</p>
              <li>Buy PRE-OWNED Hydro Flasks from websites like ebay.com. This will not only save your own money, but if will also save resources, such as the metal used to make the bottles. </li>
              <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=hydro+flask&_sacat=0&rt=nc&LH_ItemCondition=3000">Here's a link where you can buy a pre-owned Hydro Flask.</a>
              <li>Every VSCO girl NEEDS stickers on their Hydro Flask, right? Well instead of wasting tons of paper and plastic from store-bought stickers, you can make your own out of recycled paper. That way, you can help reduce the number of trees being cut down, especially since trees and plants are our only source of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. There are several DIY sticker-making videos on YouTube, such as the one below, and you can modify them by using recycled or scrap paper! </li>

              </div>

              <li>Of course water is the best possible form of hydration for your body, and normally, that should be what your drink through your Hydroflask throughout the day. However, you may sometimes be in the mood for a nice, icy refresher on a hot summer's day. Or perhaps you need an extra energy boost after a workout. Of course there is nothing wrong with that; however, instead of filling your Hydro Flask up with a store-bought drink like Gatorade or Coke, which waste plastic from their bottles and are extremly sugary and unhealthy, you can make your own healthy and delicious drinks! 
              </li>

              <a href="https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/6-homemade-energy-drinks-for-post-workout-refreshment-1666536">These are some great recipes for drinks you can fill up your Hydro Flask with.</a>
              <p>How this actually saves the turtles: The homemade stickers and the fact that it is a reuable bottle prevents a lot of plastic from ending up in the ocean and therefore causing sea turtles, and other marine creatures to swallow it and choke. Filling your Hydro Flask with a homemade drink rather than a store-bought one further reduces the plastic ending up in the ocean since you are not purchasing the plastic bottles that come with the drinks.</p>
