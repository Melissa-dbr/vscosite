<p> How to be a better "Hydroflasker" in terms of your body, money, and most importantly, the ENVIRONMENT:
	1) Buy PRE-OWNED Hydroflasks from websites like ebay.com. This will not only save your own money, but if will also save resources, such as the metal used to make the bottles. </p>
	<a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=hydro+flask&_sacat=0&rt=nc&LH_ItemCondition=3000">Here's a link where you can buy a pre-owned Hydroflask.</a>
	<p>
	2) Every VSCO girl NEEDS stickers on their Hydroflask, right? Well instead of wasting tons of paper and plastic from store-bought stickers, you can make your own out of recycled paper. That way, you can help reduce the number of trees being cut down, especially since trees and plants are our only source of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. There are several DIY sticker-making videos on YouTube, and you can modify them by using recycled or scrap paper!
